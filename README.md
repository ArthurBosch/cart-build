# cart-build
Hello! 
This is a study project on React.js. A small page representing a cart of products connected to an external server. 

You can: 
- Add random items (price, picture, and title are randomized)
- Increase/decrease an amount of each item 
- Delete items

A cart will update the total price and amount of items instantly. 
Thank you for your attention.
